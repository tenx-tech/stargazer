Stargazer is a tool for manual testing UI regressions for Expo/React Native apps. It records screenshots of app screens and displays these in a browser UI for side-by-side comparison. This is useful for quick reference of screen designs, product/design review sessions, or testing for UI regressions.

## Project Structure

This tool is organized into three subprojects: `app`, `client`, and `server`. Here's what each of these projects are responsible for:

- **App:** React components to provide the automation to drive the app and record screenshots of each screen.
- **Client:** UI browser output to visualize the recorded screenshots.
- **Server:** Server to handle uploading and saving screenshot data.

## Typical Workflow

A typical workflow with Stargazer requires some setup and maintenance overhead, but then can be followed by rebuilding app screenshots whenever relevant changes happen to source code. This process takes a few minutes but allows teams to the review UI changes or test for UI regressions quickly and reliably as products develop over time. This should allow product teams to catch UI regressions early and improve confidence for iterating products quickly.

## Prerequisites

Stargazer assumes you have a React Native app developed with Expo which uses React Navigation. Stargazer depends on Expo Camera APIs and React Navigation to handle navigating through the provided screens. The tool also includes some shell scripts which require a Unix environment to run correctly.

## Quick Start

1. Run `npm install --save react-native-stargazer`.
2. Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "stargazer:init": "stargazer:init",
    "stargazer:view": "stargazer:view",
    "stargazer:server": "stargazer:server"
  }
}
```

3. Run `npm run stargazer:init`. This will create the UI browser app in your project folder.
4. Import and render the `Stargazer` app component in your app source code, passing in a `routeConfig` (see detailed usage below) and a `stargazerServerUrl`.
5. Run `npm run stargazer:server` and run `expo start` to start your app.
6. Run your app on iOS and Android and press the "Launch" button. Wait for it to upload all screenshots.
7. Run `npm run stargazer:view` to launch a local server which will render the captured app screenshots.
8. Deploy the compiled output on any hosting environment you wish.

## Detailed Usage

To use this tool in your app first install it with `npm install --save react-native-stargazer`. Stargazer works by rendering the default library export `Stargazer` component and passing in specific props. The required props look like this:

```ts
export interface StargazerRouteConfigObject extends NavigationRouteConfig {
  name: string;
  screenName: string;
  paramsForNextScreen?: {
    [key: string]: any;
  } /* Optional parameters for the next screen */;
}

export interface StargazerProps {
  backgroundColor?: string;
  autoStart?: boolean;
  disableLogging?: boolean;
  stargazerServerUrl: string;
  routeConfig: ReadonlyArray<StargazerRouteConfigObject>;
  appRouteConfig?: NavigationRouteConfigMap;
  imageAssets?: ReadonlyArray<any>;
  fontAssets?: { [key: string]: any };
}
```

Specifically, a user must provide the `routeConfig` prop which is an array of all the screens you want to record screenshots for. Each item in the array is a `StargazerRouteConfigObject` which contains a unique `name` for the screen, the `screenName` which is used by React Navigation to identify that screen, and optional params to send to the next screen. The screens will be recorded in the order they are provided in this initial array.

Here is an example of what the `routeConfig` should look like:

```js
import { FirstScreen, SecondScreen, ThirdScreen } from "./screens";

// Stargazer Route Config:
const StargazerRouteConfig = [
  {
    name: "First Screen",
    screenName: SCREEN_NAMES.FIRST_SCREEN,
    screen: () => <FirstScreen />
  },
  {
    name: "Second Screen",
    screenName: SCREEN_NAMES.SECOND_SCREEN,
    screen: () => <SecondScreen />
  },
  {
    name: "Third Screen",
    screenName: SCREEN_NAMES.THIRD_SCREEN,
    screen: () => <ThirdScreen />
  }
];
```

And an example of the corresponding top level app component:

```js
import appRoutes from "./src/routes";
import stargazerRoutes from "./src/stargazerRouteConfig";

// Top Level App Component:
export default class extends React.Component {
  render(): JSX.Element {
    return (
      <Stargazer
        appRouteConfig={appRoutes}
        routeConfig={stargazerRoutes}
        stargazerServerUrl="http://1.2.3.4:9000/screenshot"
      />
    );
  }
}
```

In addition to the route configs, you must supply a `stargazerServerUrl` which specifies the address the Stargazer server is running at. This must use your computer's IP address, e.g. `http://1.2.3.4:9000/screenshot`.

First, run `npm run stagazer:init`. This will build the output browser UI project directly into your source repository. This is simply the production build output of a Create React App which is used to render the recorded screenshots. You can check this into your source code to then deploy it and host it anywhere, or just view the screenshots locally in any development environment (run `npm run stargazer:view`). Or, if you prefer to not to you can just `.gitignore` this output folder.

If this output UI browser ever changes in a future version of `react-native-stargazer` you can simply re-run the `init` command to get a new version of the UI browser bundle (any existing screenshot data should be preserved).

Now run `npm run stargazer:server` and then launch your app in another terminal tab with Expo. When you app loads on a device you should see a screen welcoming you to Stargazer. Press the blue button to start running the recording tool. Once it's finished, it will automatically upload the recorded screenshots to the `stargazer-ui` folder in your project directory.

Once the upload process is finished, you're done! Just run `npm run stargazer:view` to view the results and repeat the upload process whenever your screen files change.
